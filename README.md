# Knowledge Map  App (NAME TBD)

## What it is

This app  is meant to help students to organize their notes and thoughts in a way that best resembles how humans connect concepts: a web. 

Users can upload their notes via PDF, docx, txt, MD, etc. and the app extracts the main ideas from the text provided, and builds a knowledge graph, where users can see which concepts are connected, along with their meanings.

The users can then talk with a chatbot that is context-aware and can explain the relationship between the concepts, along with helping answer any questions about the topic.
